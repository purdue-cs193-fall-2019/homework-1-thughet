# Tyler Hughet's first CS193 Homework

List of things I like about CS193
- It's taught by students that can tell you about the other classes
- iClicker quizzes vaguely remind me of Kahoot which is nice

Sorry if I wasnt supposed to delete the other stuff but the assignment only said that the things listed above were needed on the web page.
